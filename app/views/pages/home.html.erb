<h1>Task Description <small>What is this task all about?</small></h1>
</div>
This data collection task is part of our research project that aims to determine Citation Provenance (read more on the <a href="/about">purpose</a> of the project). The task, is to annotate scientific papers, capturing information leading to the information referred to by the citation (i.e. cited information).
<p>
<h2>Task Objective</h2>
<p>
The objective of this task is to gather manual annotations for our research. We wish to determine the classification of a citation, and the type of the citation. There is a total of <strong>12 classifications</strong>, and <strong>3 types</strong> of citation for our date collection.

			<h3>Type</h3>
			<h4>General</h4>A <strong>General</strong> citation simply means Paper A is citing Paper B in general. Paper A is making reference to Paper B as a whole, or simply giving credit for the work done by authors of Paper B.
			<h4>Specific</h4>A <strong>Specific</strong> citation means Paper A is making reference to a <strong>specific</strong> section of Paper B. For instance, Paper A makes reference to a particular system, System ABC, created/described by Paper B in Paper B's second section (e.g. Our System). Since Paper A is specifically referring to this section of the paper, we say this cite is specific.
			<h4>Undetermined</h4>In cases where it is not possible to determine the type of the citation.

<h2>Task Requirements</h2>
<p>
A participant, provided with a set of scientific papers, need to do the following:
<ul>
	<li>To determine the <strong>classification</strong> of the citation.</li>
	<li>To determine the <strong>type</strong> of the citation.</li>
	<li>To annotate the citation with the above details.</li>
</ul>
To do so, the participant needs to refer to the <strong>citing sentence</strong> in the citing paper, and attempt to locate the <strong>cited information</strong> in the cited paper. If you're ready, go on to <a href="./home#Annotate">How To Annotate</a>.

Recall that the objective of this task to determine the classification and type of the citation, and then to annotate with details about the citation. Annotating begins with a <strong>working file</strong> that will be provided to you. Your task, is to annotate by entering information into this working file. See that the <strong>first 3 lines</strong> has already been filled with the details. Don't worry about that dash / numbers / question mark means for now, we'll explain it shortly.
</p>
<h2>What do I need?</h2>
<p>To perform this task you would need:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>working file</strong>, which tells you the citation relationship between papers. E.g. <code>A00-1003==>P99-1029</code> means <strong>A00-1003</strong> cites <strong>P99-1029</strong>.</li>
<li>A set of scientific papers (as referred to in the working file). Each file is named with its ID. E.g. <strong>A00-1001.txt</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You would also need to use your favourite text editor that has <strong>line number display</strong>. <span class="muted">(I recommended <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>)</span></p>
</div>

<div class="span4">
<strong>Sample Working File</strong>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
A00-1003==>P99-1029,PSim,-
A00-1004==>A00-1019,CoCoGM,46!153-188
A00-1004==>J93-1006,?,?
A00-1004==>J93-2003,
A00-1004==>P91-1022,
A00-1004==>P91-1023,
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<h2>How do I <small>actually</small> annotate?</h2>
In the working file, we capture annotations in "3 columns" separated by the comma.
<div class="row">
<div class="span6">
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h3 align="center"><i>&lt;cite&gt;,&lt;classification&gt;,&lt;type&gt;</i></h3>
</div>
<p><strong>&lt;cite&gt;</strong> would be provided for you already. E.g. <code>A00-1003==>P99-1029</code></p>
<p><strong>&lt;classfication&gt;</strong> is one of the 12 classifications. E.g. <code>PSim</code></p>
<p><strong>&lt;type&gt;</strong> is one of the 3 types. E.g. <code>8!152-155</code></p>
<div class="alert alert-error">
<p>It is <strong>important</strong> that you know the explanations of classifications & types. Click <a href="/classification">here</a> to read more.</p>

</div>
</div>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>The general approach to annotating one citation is as follow:</p>
<pre>
<ol>
<li>Can the type of citation determined? Yes (Go to step 3) / No (Go to step 2).
<li>Annotate as Undetermined. Go to step 6.
<li>Is the citation Specific? Yes (Go to step 5) / No (Go to step 4).
<li>Annotate as General. Go to step 6.
<li>Annotate as Specific. Go to step 6.
<li>End.
</ol>
# Note: Recall the variations for Specific citations.
# Note: For multi-locations, it can be a combination of single-line and multi-line i.e. <code>46!153-188</code> or <code>153-188!200</code>
</pre>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The following is the general steps you need to take to complete this task:</p>
<pre>
<ol>
<li>Use your favourite text editor that has line number display. I recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>.
<li>Open up the <strong>working file</strong>.
<li>Start from the first un-annotated entry you find.
<li>Open up the papers as identified by the IDs.
<li>In the cited paper, look for Author Names, Title, and Year of Publication. This gives you a clue how the citation would look like. With this info, look at the <strong>References</strong> section in the citing paper. Look for the citing sentence that contains the citation in the citing paper.
<li>Once you found the citing sentence, read briefly to find out that citation is for, and what cited information it is referring to.
<li>Now you know what the citation is for, look for the cited information in the cited paper. Then determine the type of the citation.
<li>Annotate according to the <strong>Approach</strong>.
<li>Repeat step 3 till you are done.
</ol>
