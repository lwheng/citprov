<h1>Task Description <small>What is this task all about?</small></h1>
</div>
<p>
	In this task, you will be annotating scientific papers with details about the <b>type</b> of citations. When you annotate for the scientific papers, you will need to read through a set of <b>citing papers</b> to look for <b>citing sentences</b> and a set of <b>cited papers</b> to look for the <b>cited information</b>. Finally for each citation, you will annotate by selecting the lines in the cited paper which you think is where the cited information.
</p>
<h2>Task Objective</h2>
<p>
The objective of this task is to gather manual annotations for our research. We wish to determine the type of the citation. There is a total of <b>3 types</b> of citation. Find out more <%= link_to "here", citation_path %>.
</p>
<!-- <h2>Task Requirements</h2>
<p>
	You will need to download the scientific papers, and the working file to complete the task. You will annotate for the scientific papers, entering the details into the working file. At the end of the task, you are only required to submit your annotation in the <b>working file</b>.

<h1>How To Annotate?</h1>
</div>
<p>We have created an interface to aid you in this annotation tasks. On the Annotate page, you will be presented with 2 papers: The citing paper and the cited paper.</p>
<p>For the citing paper, you will only be shown the <b>citing context</b>, i.e. the part of the citing paper that contains the in-text citation.</p>
<p>For the cited paper, you will be shown the entire paper. For the citation, you will determine the type of citation, and select the lines which you think is where the cited information.</p>
<h2>General Steps</h2>
<%= form_tag(nil, :class => "well") do %>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Annotate page.</li>
	<li>Enter your NUS matric or MTurk ID. You should now see the citing context, and the cited paper.</li>
	<li>Read the citing context on the left side of the page.</li>
	<li>On the right side of the page, decide on the type of the citation, and select one of the options. You are only to select or make changes to your selection (in the cited paper) if you choose Specific.</li>
	<li>If you think the citation is a Specific one, read the cited paper, and click to select the lines which you think is where the cited information.</li>
	<li>Click "Submit Annotations" to submit the annotations for <b>this</b> record. Once submitted, you will be presented another record for you to annotate.</li>
	<li>If you wish to end your session, <b>remember to click on "Quit Annotating" at the top-right of the page</b>. If you annotated some records, you will be presented with a MD5 hash, which facilitates your payment on MTurk. To view past MD5 hash generated for you, "log in" by entering your NUS matric or MTUrk ID, and click on "My Annotations" on the top navigation bar.</li>

			<p><b>Downloading the necessary files</b></p>
			<li>Download the scientific papers and the working file. Download them <%= link_to "here", download_path, :target => "_blank" %>.</li>
			<li>Open the <b>working file</b></li>
			<li>Look at the first entry that is not annotated, and open the <b>citing paper</b> and the <b>cited paper</b>.</li>
			<p>
			<p><b>Locating the citation</b> (<%= link_to "What is citing/cited paper, citation?", citation_path %>)</p>
			<li>Look for the <b>cited paper</b>'s <b>title</b>, <b>author(s) names</b>.</li>
			<li>Look for this <b>title</b> and <b>author(s)</b> in the <b>citing paper</b>'s References section (at the bottom/end of paper). You are now determining how the <b>citation</b> looks like.</li>
			<li>Look for the entry in the References section that matches the <b>title</b> and <b>author(s)</b>. This entry will tell you how the citation looks like. The citation would either be numbered or be made up using the first author's last name. E.g. <b>[12]</b> or <b>(Smith, 1999)</b>.</li>
			<li>Look for the <b>citing sentence</b> that contains the citation.</li>
			<p>
			<p><b>Locating the cited information</b></p>
			<li>Read the citing sentence for the context. Determine the type of the citation (<%= link_to "How?", type_path %>).</li>
			<li>Annotate for that citation entry</li>
			<li>Repeat Step 3 till you are done with all entries.</li>
